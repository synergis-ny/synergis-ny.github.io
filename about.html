<article>
  <p>Synergis is a community of GIS professionals, managers, researchers, and students from Ithaca, NY
    and the surrounding area.  We hold occasional meetings that are open to anyone interested
    in learning more about GIS and all things geospatial.</p>
    
  <p>The group originally formed in the early 2000s, and has hosted various meetings and
    events for over a decade.  In 2014, we established ourselves as an official chapter of the
    New York State GIS Association, and are currently working to revitalize Synergis with more
    frequent presentions and discussions led by community members and invited guests, as well
    as occasional "mappy hours" for more casual gatherings.</p>

  <p>Current members of the Synergis Steering Committee:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ben Coakley (chair)</li>
    <li>Svetla Borovska</li>
    <li>David Jorgensen</li>
    <li>Frank Popowitch</li>
  </ul>
