  <p>SynerGIS is a community of GIS professionals, managers, researchers, and students from Ithaca, NY
    and the surrounding area.  We hold almost-monthly meetings that are open to anyone interested
    in learning more about GIS and all things geospatial.</p>
    
  <p>The group originally formed sometime around 2005 or earlier.  We are currently working to revitalize
    Synergis with regular presentions and discussions led by community members, and occasional "mappy hours"
    at the Chapter House in Ithaca.  We are also seeking official recognition as a chapter of the New York
    State GIS Association.</p>
