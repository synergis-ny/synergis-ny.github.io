<article>
  <p>Synergis is a community of GIS professionals, managers, researchers, and students from Ithaca, NY
    and the surrounding area.  We hold occasional meetings that are open to anyone interested
    in learning more about GIS and all things geospatial.</p>
    
  <p>The group originally formed sometime around 2005 or earlier, and has hosted various meetings and
    events over the past decade.  In 2014, we established ourselves as an official chapter of the
    New York State GIS Association, and are currently working to revitalize Synergis with more frequent
    presentions and discussions led by community members, as well as occasional "mappy hours" at the
    Chapter House in Ithaca.  (Alas, we must now find another venue...)</p>

  <p>Current members of the Synergis Steering Committee (since February 2014):</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ben Coakley (chair)</li>
    <li>Nick Hollingshead (liaison to NYSGISA)</li>
    <li>Emily Goldman</li>
    <li>Keith Jenkins</li>
    <li>Boris Michev</li>
    <li>Frank Popowitch</li>
  </ul>
