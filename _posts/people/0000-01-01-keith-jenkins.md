excerpt: GIS Librarian at Cornell
---

I'm the GIS/Geospatial Applications Librarian at Cornell University's Mann Library, so I spend a lot of time looking for data and troubleshooting GIS software.

I work mostly with ArcGIS and Manifold, for which I teach introductory workshops each semester, but I have been using QGIS more and more, and am developing a QGIS workshop as well.

Mann Library has run [CUGIR (Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository)](http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu) for over 15 years.  As the project leader, I am planning a complete migration of CUGIR to a completely new infrastructure, based on open source software including [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) and [OpenGeoportal](http://opengeoportal.org/).
