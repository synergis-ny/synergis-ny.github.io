First, we have 10-15 minutes of networking time.  Then, two of our colleagues will engage us, inspires and involve us!

# DYI Web Mapping

**Chris Marx (Cornell Lab of Ornithology)**

A presentation of platforms for web based mapping for you and your agency -- ones you know and ones you might not have seen!  Chris has been researching and implementing open source solutions -- some are full platforms, others good and flexible for quick projects.  As you know, there are platforms for creating just about any web mapping application you could think of.  

# Web Based Integration GIS - Crowd Sourcing of Historical Records: A Community Approach

**Bob Kibbee (former Map Librarian at Cornell)**

Bob Kibbee will show us the records, the goals, and the challenge of creating crowd-sourced GIS data from historical records and maps.  For those who have heard of this project, Bob will update you on his progress.  If you have not seen this fascinating project, you will be quickly up to speed.  This integration project mixes new technologies and ole' fashioned GIS in a most unique way.  And the "how" is up for discussion.  Let's roll up our sleeves and see what we as a group can add -- brainstorming to follow Bob's update. Bring packed lunch, networking, presentations and group discussion.
