Starting at noon, there will be a Synergis "business meeting" held at 12pm.  Anyone who is interested in the future of Synergis or would like to help plan future meeting topics is encouraged to attend.  Maybe you would like to present something???

Then, at 12:30pm, we will begin with a half hour (or so) of meet-and-greet â€” a great chance to catch up with your GIS colleagues!  And then...

# OpenStreetMap

**Keith Jenkins, GIS Librarian at Mann Library, Cornell University**

Learn how to edit the map and add your own knowledge of the world to this ever-expanding project.
