We are pleased to announce the next Synergis meeting "Mapping Historical Addresses-HistoryForge Ithaca and Beyond" by Eve Snyder, HistoryForge Project Coordinator and Claire Lovell, Auburn HistoryForge. The meeting will be on Zoom January 4 at 1 pm. We will send a link when we get closer.

HistoryForge is an open-source web application which combines historical census records, maps, photographs, and other sources to create an interactive web environment to explore local history. Eve Snyder and Claire Lovell will discuss mapping historical addresses using HistoryForge.

They will also discuss their use of MapWarper to georectify the historic maps and plans for a future project of expanding into the Town of Caroline and other areas in Tompkins County that have fewer maps and addressing resources.
