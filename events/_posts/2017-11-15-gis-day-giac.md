Wednesday, November 15 is GIS Day, and we're planning to host an event.
GIS Day is an opportunity for GIS users around the world to demonstrate
how we use GIS to make a difference - learn more at http://www.gisday.com/

Our event will be held at the Greater Ithaca Activities Center (GIAC) on
Court Street in Ithaca, from 12:00 - 4:00 on November 15.  We'd like to
invite everyone who uses GIS in Tompkins County to share their work at
this event.

You can share a poster, or a live demo - we'll supply a table and wi-fi,
you supply a laptop or whatever other device you need.  Our audience will
include your GIS-using colleagues, interested members of the public, and
students in the GIAC afterschool program.
