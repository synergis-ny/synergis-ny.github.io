# Cornell Geospatial Forum

Please join us for the first annual [Cornell Geospatial Forum](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/cugeo/Cornell+Geospatial+Forum+2014), a one-day gathering of faculty, staff, students, and community members to discuss the past, present, and future of geospatial science and technology at Cornell.

Spatial analyses and place-based studies are more important than ever in the world today, and the digital technologies that support such work are becoming much more commonplace and in high demand. At Cornell we are at a turning point, as we face increasing demands and opportunities for support of geospatial research, teaching, and extension, while at the same time lacking a clear vision for how such demands will be met, especially as several key players from within our geospatial community transition out through retirement.

Help pave the way forward by joining us at our inaugural Cornell Geospatial Forum. At this one-day event, we will highlight some of the many innovative and cross-disciplinary applications at Cornell, share ideas and research, learn about existing and emerging campus-wide resources, and lay the groundwork for the future of geospatial science and technology at Cornell. We hope you will join us for this important conversation. We request those who plan to attend, and those unable to attend but interested in the future of geospatial science and technology at Cornell, to complete our Working Group Discussion questions which will form the basis for communicating the outcomes of CUGEO 2014 to the Cornell Community.
