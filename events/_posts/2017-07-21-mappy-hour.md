Let's get together and talk about what we are all doing with GIS.
Join us at [the Westy on State Street](http://www.thewestyisabar.com/) on Friday, July 21.
There is food nearby that we can bring out back (Saigon Kitchen & Franco's Pizzeria).
We'll start around 5:00 pm and guests are always welcome.
Hopefully it will be nice enough to sit outside.
