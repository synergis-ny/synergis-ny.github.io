# Cornell Geospatial Forum

Please join us for CUGEO 2015, the second annual [Cornell Geospatial Forum](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/cugeo/Cornell+Geospatial+Forum+2015), a one-day gathering of faculty, staff, students, and community members to discuss geospatial science and technology research and extension at Cornell and the surrounding Ithaca community.

Spatial analyses and place-based studies are more important than ever in the world today, and the digital technologies that support such work are becoming much more widespread, and skills to use them are in high demand.  Cornell and the larger Ithaca community are in the unique position to take advantage of this due to the large amount of geospatial work being done in the area.

At this one-day event, we will highlight some of the many innovative and cross-disciplinary applications at Cornell, share ideas and research, and learn about existing and emerging campus-wide resources.
