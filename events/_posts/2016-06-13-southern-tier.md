# Southern Tier GIS Users Group

Our neighbors to the south have invited us to their next meeting!

> The Southern Tier GIS Users Group will be meeting 10 a.m., Monday, June 13 in Room 322 of the Chemung County Human Resource Center, 425 Pennsylvania Avenue, Elmira.  This will be a combined meeting with the Chemung County GIS Consortium.  Josh Williams from Esri’s Boston office will be speaking and answering your questions about the Esri software, so be thinking about things that you would like to ask.

After crossing the bridge over the Chemung River continue “straight” onto Pennsylvania Ave.  After passing under the railroad viaduct, turn left at the second street onto W LaFrance St which will take you to the parking lot by the main entrance to the building.
