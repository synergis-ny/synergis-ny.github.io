# The Latest in GPS

Bring your own device (if you have one).

UPDATE: Those who ventured down to Stewart Park for this impromptu meeting got a sneak peak at the Google Trekker backpack that was used by staff at the [City of Ithaca GIS Program](http://www.cityofithaca.org/333/GIS-Program) to capture the Ithaca-area gorge trails.  This imagery was officially added to Google Street View on November 19, 2015.  Here's a [link to the Cascadilla Gorge Trail](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.443094,-76.492982,3a,75y,89.11h,75.78t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1so69c3kCpsGXANZ0dM9V_3g!2e0!3e5) to get you started!
