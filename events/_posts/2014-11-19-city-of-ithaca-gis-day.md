# City of Ithaca GIS Day

Please join us for the official launch of the Ithaca area Google Street View imagery.
Google will launch the imagery and we will host a demonstration of the new areas of imagery
that were captured with the Google Trekker backpack. The City of Ithaca GIS Program staff
partnered with Cornell University, Ithaca College and The Museum of the Earth/Cayuga Nature
Center to gather the Google Street View imagery of our Gorges, parks, golf course, trails,
and more. Partnerships like this should be celebrated, so please come to City Hall and join us!
