It seems like December 12 at 3:00 is the most convenient time to meet up
at the History Center to gather and explore their Maps of Tompkins County
Exhibition. This was just brought up at GIS Day as an informal gathering
to explore what the Center has to offer. If you are available, come see
what the History Center has displayed in the form of local maps for the
City.

From their newsletter:
> The Maps of Tompkins County
>
> From November 14 through mid-2018
>
> Maps are powerful and engaging forms of visual communication. They show us our world, and the myriad smaller places within it. Maps simplify, scale down, and organize what otherwise would be too large, too distant, or too complex to be seen. 
>
> Maps fulfill a multitude of functions, and are used for a variety of purposes. Political maps, railway maps, waterway maps, soil maps; from cross-sections of lake water depth to trolley routes; maps are irresistible and invaluable resources for learning about our environment in all its tremendous diversity. 
>
> This exhibit displays a sampling of The History Center's map collection from the 19th through the 21st centuries.
