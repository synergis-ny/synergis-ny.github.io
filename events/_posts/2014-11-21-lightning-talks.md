# Lightning Talks

For our November meeting, we'd like to give SynerGIS members an opportunity to
introduce themselves and talk about how they use GIS.  Please join us, and be
ready to give a short talk about your own particular GIS niche.  Each speaker
should plan to talk for about five minutes; you're welcome to put together a
few slides if you like, but we'd like to keep the talks short and informal.
There are SynerGIS members using GIS to do all sorts of cool things.  Come out
and share your cool things with the most appreciative audience available:
your fellow GIS users.
